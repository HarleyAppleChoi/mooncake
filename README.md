# Dwitter
Dwitter is a decentralized version of [Twitter](https://twitter.com), entirely based on the 
[Desmos blockchain](https://github.com/desmos-labs/desmos).

It allows to post freely any kind of message, and see what all the users are writing, no follow needed. 
Everyone knows everything.

## Current state
Currently there is **no interaction** with the blockchain and **all the posts are mocked and non-interactive**.

## Development
### Requirements
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev): to know how to install it, please reference the [installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- An Android/iOS emulator or physical device. 

### Run the app
To run a local version of this application, you need to execute the following commands: 

```shell
flutter run
``` 

This will run it in either an Android or iOS emulator (or physical device).
