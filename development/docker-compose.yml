# This Docker compose file allows to instantiate all the necessary Docker containers that are needed in order
# to develop Mooncake without connecting to the public chain.
# Here is what it's created by this file:
#
# 1. A local single-node Desmos chain.
#    This is going to be the blockchain inside which the data are going to be stored.
#
# 2. A PostgreSQL database.
#    This is going to act as the data source where blockchain data are going to be persisted so that they can be easily
#    accessed by a GraphQL instance.
#
# 3. A DJuno instance.
#    This will read all the data that are inserted inside the local blockchain, and put them inside the PostgreSQL
#    database.
#
# 4. A local Hasura instance.
#    This is going to expose the GraphQL APIs on top of which Mooncake relies in order to get the data reactively.
