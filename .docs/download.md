# Downloading Mooncake

## Android
### Download from the Play Store
If you have access to the Google Play Store, you can also join the [Beta program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.forbole.mooncake) and download the new version of Mooncake as soon as they come out. 

:::warning Google Play and the COVID-19  
 Due to adjusted work schedules at this time, the Google team is currently prioritizing the review and publication of apps published, commissioned, or authorized by official government entities and public health organizations. 
 
What this means is that even tho we already published the new Mooncake version on the Google Play Store, you might not be able to see it for the time being. For this reason, if you want to have the new version without waiting for a lot of time, we suggest you [downloading it from GitHub](#download-from-github).
